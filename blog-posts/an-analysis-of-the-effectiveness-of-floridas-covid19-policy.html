                <h3>
                  An Analysis of the Effectiveness of Florida's COVID-19 Policy
                </h3>
              </div>
              <div class="blog-content">
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Many publications and politicians have levied their criticisms
                  against Governor Ron DeSantis and his policy decisions with
                  regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many articles have depicted
                  Florida as being the epicenter of an outbreak. Recent
                  criticisms have been levied against DeSantis’ ban on mask and
                  vaccine mandates. This article will look at Mayo Clinic
                  statistics and other academic publications to determine
                  whether these criticisms are justified. The aim of this
                  article is not to discredit specific criticisms or to argue
                  that the state’s policy is immune to critique. Rather this
                  article looks to determine whether the popular media is
                  justified in portraying the state’s policy as being inadequate
                  in combating the virus.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  In order to get a solid understanding of how one can judge
                  Florida’s COVID-19 policy we must note what measurements will
                  be used to quantify and compare Florida’s COVID-19 situations
                  with that of other states within the United States. Many
                  publications use the total number of cases and deaths due to
                  COVID-19 when making remarks about Florida’s policy. However,
                  this does not help us as it provides no comparative basis for
                  us to compare Florida with other states as it does not account
                  for population differences between states. In order to provide
                  a proper comparative analysis of the numbers, this article
                  will use cases per 100,000, mortality rate and vaccination
                  percentage. These numbers will give a basis for comparison.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  With regards to policy trends and recommendations currently,
                  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has banned mask and vaccine
                  mandates. He also expressed that lockdown measures would not
                  be used to combat the virus in Florida.<sup><a class="superscript"  href="#one">1</a></sup> These are
                  measures that have often been used in other states and
                  countries. The academic and medical literature is split on
                  this issue of mandates and lockdowns. On one hand the World
                  Health Organization released a statement back in October of
                  2020 discouraging governments from using lockdowns as a way of
                  combating the virus.<sup><a class="superscript"  href="#two">2</a></sup> The nearly 6,000 scientists
                  who joined the movement cited many issues including;
                  disproportionate harm to the underprivileged, lower childhood
                  vaccination rates, worsened care for chronic patients and
                  senior citizens as well as economic consequences.<sup><a class="superscript"  href="#two">2</a></sup>
                  The WHO went as far as saying that low risk individuals should
                  be allowed to work and engage in activities such as shopping
                  and in person schooling.<sup><a class="superscript"  href="#two">2</a></sup> 
                  Mask and vaccine mandates
                  are also topics which garner debate amongst experts. However,
                  most experts do state that these mandates can help to combat
                  the virus. Statistics observed by health experts showed that
                  mask mandates significantly lowered the incidence of
                  developing all symptoms of COVID-19.<sup><a class="superscript"  href="#three">3</a></sup> Although
                  masks were not observed to be a fool proof way of combating
                  the virus, they still helped enough that having these mandates
                  in place made sense from a policy standpoint. With regards to
                  vaccine statistics from hospitalization records show that a
                  majority of those who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 are
                  either unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated.<sup><a class="superscript"  href="#six">6</a></sup> This
                  speaks to the vaccine’s effectiveness in fighting the virus.
                  However, expert studies show that vaccinated people can still
                  contract COVID-19 and spread it to other people.<sup><a class="superscript" href="#three">3</a></sup>
                  When considering all of the research, one can arrive at the
                  conclusion that although the effectiveness of lockdowns is in
                  question, mask and vaccine mandates provide an overall net
                  positive in combating the virus.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  The statistics from Mayo Clinic paint an interesting picture
                  of Florida and their policy decisions regarding COVID-19. When
                  looking at Florida one can see that they average 30 cases per
                  100,000 on a daily basis with 57% of the population being
                  fully vaccinated.<sup><a class="superscript" href="#four">4</a></sup> Their percentage of positive
                  cases is trending downwards with it being at 20% in August
                  compared to around 9.5% in September of 2021. Although these
                  are not the best numbers, they are superior to many
                  states.<sup><a class="superscript" href="#four">4</a></sup> Even those states who have imposed these
                  mandates regarding vaccines and masks see a small decrease in
                  cases per 100,000 and a small increase in total percentage of
                  population vaccinated. Although these are definitely improved
                  situations when compared to Florida, the numbers do not seem
                  to justify the media’s constant criticism of Florida as being
                  an epicenter for a COVID-19 outbreak.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Therefore, although Florida is not seen to be the best from a
                  statistical point of view, they are not the worst either.
                  Their percentage of population vaccinated is middle of the
                  pack and so are their cases per 100,000. Expert medical
                  opinion states that mandates do provide some benefit with
                  regards to combatting the virus but even without these
                  mandates Florida, by the numbers, is doing an average job of
                  combatting the virus. Although they could do better the
                  constant criticism in the media seems to be unjustified when
                  considering the statistics.
