              <div class="blog-content">
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Since its predecessor's dissolution–Soviet Union–Russia’s role
                  as big brother within the East has remained somewhat
                  controversial, yet strategic. Post-Soviet collapse, the region
                  between Armenia’s Eastern border, and correspondingly,
                  Azerbaijan’s Western border, has become a heated playground
                  for both periphery states to flex their arms while regional
                  neighbours such as Russia and Turkey tactically intervene on a
                  covert basis. Furthermore, while both of these states no
                  longer fall under Russian jurisdiction, global powers have
                  urged the Kremlin to deliver direct mediation between the two
                  countries before tensions escalate beyond reasonable means.
                  However, common debates have led analysts and the general
                  public to question which country should reserve jurisdiction
                  over the highly contested Nagorno-Karabakh (also referred to
                  as NK or Artsakh) region (Paylan & Makalian 2021).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  As Soviet Russia witnessed its inevitable collapse, ethnic
                  minorities such as Soviet-Armenians residing within the NK
                  region voiced their desire to depart from the former Soviet
                  Azerbaijan, and instead return to the Armenian border (Crisis
                  Group 2021). However, as Gorbachev installed his democratic
                  pillars throughout Moscow, this provided a successful
                  opportunity for fighting and warfare to take place for many
                  years until 1994, in which ethnic minorities within NK,
                  Armenia and Azerbaijan were immediately departed back to their
                  ‘home’ countries (Crisis Group 2021). Since then, the NK
                  region has rarely observed a moment of ceasefire with regular
                  gunfights, mortar strikes and drone bombings lighting up the
                  NK sky on a consistent basis (Crisis Group 2021).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Recently however, the Kremlin cracked under the pressure from
                  its Western counterparts to broker a ceasefire, thus allowing
                  both states to reconvene and potentially discuss peace
                  options. However, this ceasefire did not prevent Azerbaijan
                  from retrieving greater territory from the NK region (Crisis
                  Group 2021). Aside from mediation, both Yerevan and Baku have
                  sought military and economic aid from their war-mongering
                  neighbours including that of Iran, Israel and Russia, thus
                  also providing a window of opportunity for the bigger players
                  to get involved and potentially transform NK into something
                  similar to that of Aleppo; a proxy warfare playground (CSIS
                  2020).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Moreover, it is also questionable as to why neighbouring
                  states would like such a great say into the NK conflict. It’s
                  clear that neither Baku nor Yerevan has relinquished all its
                  dependency on third-party intervention, and in no means does
                  any side intend on falling back. Therefore, the generosity
                  demonstrated on Baku and Yerevan’s neighbour’s is at the
                  minimum, quite questionable. On the other hand however,
                  Canada’s role within the conflict thus far has remained under
                  a spotlight of suspicion. As Paylan and Makalian put it, the
                  Canadian government's response and involvement within NK has
                  been somewhat underwhelming with trade and export restrictions
                  being the primary tactic to further deter states and regional
                  powers from instigating any further conflict (Paylan &
                  Makalian 2021).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Furthermore, Canada’s hand in NK is deeper than what is
                  revealed through the actions of the Foreign Affairs office.
                  Numerous investigations have discovered that Canadian weapons
                  technology exported to the NK region was used to conduct
                  various military protocols during the recent peak of the
                  conflict, leaving a significant civilian and children casualty
                  count (Paylan & Makalian 2021). Therefore, Paylan and
                  Makalians claim of underwhelm towards Canada's efforts to
                  diffuse the situation, holds definitely true, especially
                  considering that its Foreign Affairs office is now linked to
                  civilian deaths.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Aside from trade restrictions, Canada’s Foreign Affairs office
                  has provided minimal effort throughout the process of
                  diffusing the tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia. As
                  regional powers such as Iran and Turkey begin to mount on each
                  side of the conflict, tensions are continuing to increase,
                  with a greater likelihood of an all-out war, or at the minimum
                  a mass-proxy war being triggered at the earliest convenience.
                  Yet, Canada’s only contribution to the conflict has resulted
                  in Baku and Yerevan resorting to other means in order to
                  achieve their domination of the region.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Overall, the NK crisis is not an easy-fix. Having persisted
                  decades after its initial onset, NK has turned into a highly
                  contested area with both sides of the conflict refusing to
                  extend its courtesy to the other. Additionally, neighbouring
                  regional powers have observed NK as an opportunity to transfer
                  their on-going disputes and regional conflicts to a newer,
                  more mountainous, playing field. As these regional war-hungry
                  states prepare themselves for a mass-scale conflict, countries
                  such as Canada and Russia, whom of which have contributed
                  directly to escalations within the region, are taking the
                  minimalist approach towards providing any form of resolution
                  between the two states. As a result, both NK and the rest of
                  the region remain in a state of confusion regarding Artsakhs’
                  future.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text" style="text-indent: 0%">
                  Perhaps an East-meets-West coalition to liberate Artsakh from
                  this map-drawing contest? Sounds a bit too good to be true.
