                  The Thai political system is currently in shambles. It’s
                  always been that way, as one can say about any other country,
                  but the current pandemic has done nothing but amplify the
                  current state of affairs in Thailand. At the beginning of the
                  pandemic,

                    against the spread of COVID-19</a
                  >. A hundred cases quickly turned to twenty because of the
                  admirable work of the government. They did everything right.
                  Somewhere along the way a revolution sparked. The facade of
                  the shining star dimmed and a whole new generation of students
                  marched down the streets of Bangkok petitioning against the
                  government. But why? After everything they have done for the
                  Thai people, how could one possibly despise the current
                  administration?
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Well...it’s complicated. Political tensions had always been
                  boiling right underneath the surface. During the 2019 general
                  election, the success of the military party, led by General
                  Prayut, was met with a lot of controversy and distrust. A
                  subset of citizens, mostly those in support of the Future
                  Forward Party (FFP) called the election rigged. These emotions
                  festered within the young, progressive generation of the Thai
                  people. Right before Covid lockdowns, disaster struck as the

                    >Future Forward Party (FFP) announced its dissolution</a
                  >. If you weren’t aware, the FFP was a party that was
                  incredibly critical of the military, especially General
                  Prayut. They campaigned for progressive policies and a change
                  of the Thai constitution. Protests started small on university
                  campuses in the capital of Thailand. They were eventually shut
                  down due to the new lockdown restrictions.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  For some context, it’s important to note that there is a

                    >gap between the rich and the poor in Thailand</a
                  >. A lot of Thai people who live outside the capital have
                  tried to live in Bangkok to gain opportunities for a better
                  life. Unfortunately, not everyone has been successful and has
                  been left with barely livable wages. With the new lockdown
                  restrictions, a lot of these people had to head back to their
                  provinces because they did not have the financial stability to
                  live in the city without a job.

                  On July eighteen, the largest anti-government protest
                  commenced. The police and the people butt heads in front of
                  Prime Minister Prayut. People hung around the main roads for
                  the protests to block off traffic. The police resorted to tear
                  gas, high-powered water cannons, and rubber bullets with the
                  intent to disperse the protesters. These large protests
                  spanned several days and multitudes of injuries,
                  <a

                    >including a reporter</a
                  >. At the same time, the Black Lives Matters protests were
                  occurring. Because of how reflective these two events were,
                  the Thai anti-government protests bled into international
                  news. So much so, that the
                  <a

                  >
                  in Thailand. And it did..for a while. Just enough time for the
                  government to retaliate in their way. The government
                  immediately passed an Emergency Decree that forced citizens
                  into a lockdown, not only in Bangkok but nationwide.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  The anti-government protesters had three requests that they
                  were pushing for. They wanted the dissolution of parliament, a
                  new draft of the constitution, and to put an end to police
                  brutality. On August 3, two student advocacy groups furthered
                  these requests by targeting the current monarchy. They
                  publicly criticized them while also demanding an entire reform
                  of the monarchy. This was controversial, to say the least.
                  According to
                  <a
                    style="color: maroon"
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://library.siam-legal.com/thai-law/criminal-code-royal-family-sections-107-112/"
                    >Section 112 of the Thai Criminal Code</a
                  >, it was illegal to defame, insult, or threaten anyone in the
                  royal family. It was a part of the Lèse-majesté mentality that
                  had been alive since 1908. This eventually led to another
                  large protest that was meant to challenge the current king of
                  Thailand. As a response to this, the Prayut administration
                  <a
                    style="color: maroon"
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/thailand-emergency-decree-restricts-press-freedom.html"
                    >declared an Emergency Decree</a
                  >
                  that restricted the freedom of the press and would punish
                  those who would broadcast any information that could cause
                  public fear. This immediately targeted the younger generation
                  who have been using the internet to spread their beliefs and
                  voices against the existing powers that be. This led to the
                  arrest of dozens of pro-democracy members arrests.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  The protests had died down but the distastefulness against the
                  government proceeded into 2021. This was because they
                  mishandled the Covid vaccines. Thailand had started as the
                  beacon of hope during the pandemic because of how well they
                  have handled the cases, despite the internal political
                  turmoil. But after the neglect of the Prayut administration,
                  <a

                  >
                    twenty cases eventually became a whopping twenty thousand</a
                  >, all within a few months. Prayut had been too focused on

                  due to the failing economy thus forgetting to sign the

                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  With all of this in mind, I would have to applaud the student
                  body of Thailand who has done nothing but perseveres through
                  the inherent harassment, arrests, and corruption that is
                  currently happening in Thailand. It is also important to talk
                  about the poor population in Thailand who have stuck through
                  these students through protests and riots. These people have
                  nothing to lose when the pandemic has already stripped away
                  everything they once had. And if one has nothing to lose, they
                  have everything to gain by fighting back. I do not live in
                  Thailand anymore but I do hope that the change that they have
                  been fighting for eventually becomes their reality.
