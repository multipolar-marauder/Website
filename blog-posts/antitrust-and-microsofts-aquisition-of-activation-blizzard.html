                <h3>
                    Antitrust and Microsoft's Acquisition of Activision Blizzard
                </h3>
              </div>
              <div class="blog-content">
                <p class="blog-text">
                    On January 18th, 2022, Microsoft Corp. announced that it will 
                    be buying the popular game studio Activision Blizzard for $68.7 
                    billion. Some of the franchises in the Activision roster include 
                    Call of Duty, Diablo, Candy Crush, and Overwatch. Apart from these 
                    marquee properties, Activision Blizzard has a whole host of game 
                    studio subsidiaries with additional intellectual property. Importantly, 
                    this acquisition will make Microsoft the third largest gaming company 
                    in the world after Tencent and Sony. When Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella 
                    was asked about a potential regulatory block of the deal on antitrust 
                    grounds, he brushed aside any such concerns with the following statement:
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    “At the end of the day, all the analysis here has to be done 
                    through a lens of what’s the category we’re talking about, and 
                    what about the market structure? Eve3n post-this acquisition, 
                    we will be number three with sort of low teens [market] share, 
                    where even the highest player is also [in the] teens [for market] 
                    share. It shows how fragmented content creation platforms are. And 
                    so, that’s the fundamental category. Yes, we will be a big player in 
                    what is a highly fragmented place.” 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    Nevertheless, the Federal Trade Commission will complete an antitrust 
                    review of the deal to ensure that it does not hinder competition 
                    within the industry. Microsoft as a company is also not new to antitrust
                    issues, remembering their antitrust lawsuit in 2001. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Now, while there is speculation that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision 
                  Blizzard is expected to move forward without issue, this is not the only 
                  major game developer Microsoft has acquired. Just last year in 2021 they 
                  bought Zenimax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, developer 
                  of the popular Fallout franchise. Importantly, these major acquisitions also 
                  involve the subsidiaries of these parent companies which also include extremely 
                  popular and valuable intellectual property like Doom, Wolfenstein, etc. So, 
                  these are not single studio buys but rather the acquisition of behemoths in 
                  the gaming space. In total, with the latest Activision deal Microsoft's number 
                  of game developers will go up to 32. Meanwhile, close rival Sony has 17 such
                  developers in total. 

                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    So, what does this all mean from an antitrust standpoint? While Microsoft 
                    will now be the third-largest gaming company by revenue, still behind Sony, 
                    they have been acquiring the biggest game developers, have more developers 
                    than Sony, and through these deals are acquiring universally popular titles 
                    like the Call of Duty franchise. Speculation right now states that the FTC 
                    investigation into the deal will look at competitor access to these big game 
                    titles, with the combination of Activision's gaming roster with Microsoft's 
                    consoles being both a horizontal and vertical market integration. Important 
                    to note is that both Microsoft and Sony have been focusing on developing and 
                    promoting exclusive titles to make their consoles more enticing. In the past 
                    Sony’s PlayStation exclusive titles have made them dominant in this regard, 
                    with console unit sales much greater than those of Microsoft. However, with 
                    the acquisition of so many huge franchises it will be interesting to see what 
                    Microsoft does and does not make exclusive going forward, and how this will 
                    impact the market landscape. Already The Elder Scrolls VI, which will be the 
                    latest release in the Elder Scrolls franchise developed by Bethesda, will be 
                    Xbox exclusive. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    The big question becomes what happens with extremely popular Activision titles 
                    like Call of Duty, Microsoft has stated that they will honour any current 
                    multiplatform agreements, but no one knows what will happen with future titles. 
                    This is part of the speculation around the FTC investigation of this acquisition, 
                    as Microsoft buys up more and more of the major game developers and game titles, 
                    what will happen to competition should they choose to make these titles Microsoft 
                    exclusive. This is all without considering Xbox game pass. Microsoft's 
                    subscription-based gaming service. The situation becomes even more complex if 
                    Microsoft decides to make these popular gaming titles game pass exclusive. 
                    Specifically, it raises the question of whether Sony would be forced to offer 
                    game pass on PlayStation to appease customers, and how regulatory bodies would 
                    view this from an antitrust standpoint.  
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    When looking at these regulatory bodies, the FTC chair Lina Khan is a strong critic 
                    of big tech, under Khan the FTC has already blocked the acquisition of ARM by Nvidia 
                    and is trying to win a case which would make Meta sell off WhatsApp and Instagram. 
                    They have also filed a lawsuit to prevent Lockheed Martin's deal with Aerojet 
                    Rocketdyne Holdings from going through. While this does not mean that Microsoft's 
                    acquisition of Activision will be blocked, it does signal that the FTC under Khan 
                    will implement a more rigorous regulatory process. In fact, on the same day that 
                    Microsoft announced its acquisition of Activision, the FTC along with the United 
                    States Department of Justice announced that they would work to “modernize federal 
                    merger guidelines to better detect and prevent illegal, anti-competitive deals.”, 
                    stating that “many industries across the economy are becoming more concentrated and 
                    less competitive”. 
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    What this all boils down to is that while Microsoft may appear to be confident 
                    regarding the regulatory approval of this acquisition (with a $3 billion breakup 
                    fee clause if it does not go through), there is still uncertainty as to what this 
                    FTC headed by Lina Khan will do, what Microsoft's next moves will mean for antitrust 
                    in the gaming industry, and what the gaming industry will even look like in the 
                    future if such massive acquisitions continue.
