                <h3>The Texan Abortion Ban</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="blog-content">
                <p class="blog-text">
                  The recent texas abortion ban has been one of the strictest
                  American laws against abortion in what seems like decades.
                  This new abortion law had been passed in May and had recently
                  taken effect on September 1st. This law states that if a woman
                  is six weeks pregnant there is no way for them to have an
                  abortion. This is around the time cardiac activity can be
                  detected in the fetus. There are no exceptions for rape,
                  abuse, or incest. What makes this law even more mindboggling
                  is that the public can sue anyone who gets an abortion or is
                  suspected of “aiding and abetting” abortions. This includes
                  any abortion clinics or even taxi drivers who drive women to
                  get abortions. If the lawsuit is successful they receive a
                  $10,000 prize at the expense of the defendant. So, with all
                  that in mind, what does the public have to say about this
                  outrageous law?
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Pro-choice activists were enraged by this law. First and
                  foremost, six weeks is not enough for a woman to find out
                  whether or not they are pregnant. Usually, the first
                  indication that they are pregnant is through late
                  menstruation. Being two weeks late for your period is normal
                  and happens to every woman and it does not always lead to a
                  pregnancy check-up. Doctors oppose this law heavily as the
                  legislation is not all that clear with the “heartbeat of the
                  fetus”. Cardiac activity does not always mean that a heartbeat
                  exists within the fetus. This shows how flimsy the law is.
                  Republican Governor Greg Abbott shows pride within this flawed
                  legislature by signing it and saying “ensures that the life of
                  every unborn child who has a heartbeat will be saved from the
                  ravages of abortion.”
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Not only is the ban of abortions despicable, but the incentive
                  to bring civil cases forward regarding other women’s abortions
                  is atrocious. The nonprofit, pro-life organization Texas Right
                  to Life has set up a ‘whistleblower” website where people can
                  submit anonymous tips regarding women having abortions or
                  anyone aiding the act. This brings up the idea that people can
                  essentially be “bounty hunters” for women seeking abortions.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  If you thought that the Supreme Court would be the saving
                  grace, you would be wrong. The Supreme Court had recently
                  refused to block the piece of legislature. It was a 5 to 4
                  vote, with Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr. voting along with
                  the three liberal justices. This is a shocking decision,
                  <a
                    style="color: maroon"
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion.html"
                    >Justice Sonia Sotomayor had some choice words with the
                    decision</a
                  >
                  saying, “Presented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly
                  unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from
                  exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial
                  scrutiny, a majority of justices have opted to bury their
                  heads in the sand.”
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  It seems like Uber and Lyft had fought back and protected
                  those seeking abortions more than the federal government has.
                  They had announced in early September that they will cover any
                  legal fees that their drivers will have to deal with if civil
                  lawsuits were made against them regarding the new Texan
                  abortion bans. This makes sure that there is no fear in taking
                  in pregnant women and driving them to other states to help
                  them with abortions.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Reading through the legislature, it is obvious that this is a
                  blatant disregard of a woman’s rights as this not only makes
                  abortion a legal debate but has bled into civil law. This
                  makes pregnant women a target for “bounty hunters”. This clear
                  violation of personal rights should not be a part of a
                  conversation that is often dictated by men in power. The
                  existing patriarchy does not leave room for women to be able
                  to make decisions over their bodies. The current fight for
                  liberation of women’s rights is still a fight that needs to be
                  fought by men, women, and allies.
