                <p class="blog-text">
                  In May 2021 Noah Zatzman, senior advisor to Green Party Leader
                  Annamie Paul released the following on his social media.
                </p>
                <img
                  src="../Images/annamie1.jpg"

                  class="center responsive-image"
                />
                <p class="image-text-small">
                  Noah Zatzmans controversial Facebook post (Facebook)
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">Most alarming was the following:</p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  “We will not accept an apology after you realize what you’ve
                  done. We will work to defeat you and bring in progressive
                  climate champions who are antifa and pro LGBT and pro
                  indigenous sovereignty and Zionists!!!!!”.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  This last part of Zatzman’s post was of specific concern to
                  the Green Party. Perceived as a promise to defeat the party’s
                  own MPs after two Green MPs had publicly spoken about the
                  conflict just days earlier. Following these comments by
                  Zatzman the Green Party’s Federal Committee asked Annamie Paul
                  to distance herself from and condemn Zatzmans comments, which
                  she did not do. Not supporting her own MPs or condemning
                  Zatzman’s comments. Zatzman posted this during a contentious
                  time in Annamie Paul's term as Green Leader when two Green
                  members of parliament (MPs) Jenica Atwin and Paul Manly were
                  speaking out about the Israel-Palestine conflict.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  On May 10th, 2021, MP Manly tweeted that Palestinian removal
                  from the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah was “ethnic cleansing”.
                  Manly also responded to Zatzmans May 14th post stating the
                  following:
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  "I think using accusations of antisemitism to shut down
                  legitimate criticism of human rights abuses is offensive and
                  dangerous, and it dilutes the weight that word carries when
                  it's used to identify real antisemitism."
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  In addition, on May 11th, 2021, MP Atwin tweeted the following
                  in regard to the Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle
                  East response to the Green Party and Leader Annamie Paul's
                  statement on the issue:
                </p>
                <img
                  src="../Images/annamie2.jpg"
                  alt="Annamie pic 2"
                  class="center responsive-image"
                />
                <p class="image-text-small">
                  MP Jenica Atwin’s response to party leader Annamie Paul's
                  statement on the conflict (Twitter)
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Paul's comments on the matter were seen as not being in line
                  with the Green Party’s existing stance on the issue. Atwin
                  opposed Paul's stance on the conflict, stating that Paul's
                  comments were “totally inadequate”. Atwin crossed the floor to
                  join the Liberal Party on June 10th, when asked whether
                  division over the Israel-Palestine conflict played a role in
                  her departure she stated, “It certainly played a role”. After
                  Atwins departure Green Party MP Manly, and MP Elizabeth May
                  released a statement saying that “Unfortunately, the attack
                  against Ms. Atwin by the Green Party leader's chief
                  spokesperson on May 14th created the conditions that led to
                  this crisis," clearly stating that Mr. Zatzmans attack on the
                  Green Party's own members played a major role in MP Atwin
                  crossing the aisle.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  This controversy with Noah Zatzman and the aforementioned MPs
                  clearly signalled the divide within the Green Party between
                  Annamie Paul, the Green Party Federal Committee, and other
                  Green MPs. With the federal committee going so far as to set a
                  vote of no confidence over Paul's leadership on July 20th,
                  2021, right before the fall federal election. This vote was
                  cancelled just 2 days before it was set to take place after
                  Paul took the party to arbitration proceedings. Importantly,
                  the growing division in the party and controversy around
                  Annamie Paul as leader does not boil down to just this
                  particular conflict. An article written by former Green leader
                  and MP Elizabeth May published October 3rd, 2021, sheds more
                  light on the situation. May's article outlines how Paul
                  regarded her position from the very start of her tenure as
                  leader, and some of the lesser known actions taken by Paul
                  after the Greens failed fall election run.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  The Green Party lost 1 of their 3 seats in the 2021 fall
                  election and dropped from holding 6.5% of the national vote to
                  2.3%. After this “Terrible election result” May felt the need
                  to speak out about the leadership situation. Within her
                  article she outlines how Paul’s views clashed with the party
                  ideology from the very beginning. Traditionally the Green
                  Party has treated the leadership position as one without any
                  major power within the party. May says that Paul seemed to
                  disagree with this idea, stating that Paul thought she would
                  have a “CEO/Chair” position, like that in an “American
                  business model” a completely opposite view from that of the
                  party. This was a clear point of contention between Paul and
                  the party, usually the Greens leadership position is devoid of
                  many aspects of the more traditional party leader position.
                  For example, the leader can not set policy, and solely
                  represents the policies of party members. However, when
                  elected as leader, Paul demanded a level of authority no
                  leader was given before. Paul insisted on being allowed to
                  choose the party campaign manager, made key decisions behind
                  closed doors, and maintained an absolute authoritarian style
                  hold over the party's public communication. Paul also did not
                  carry out some of the duties expected of the Green leader,
                  like appointing deputy leaders and preparing a shadow cabinet.
                  May says the snowballing of all of these leadership issues
                  strained the relationship between Paul and the Greens Federal
                  Committee.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  According to MP May’s article, the controversy does not end
                  here. May says that while Paul publicly resigned as leader on
                  September 28th, she told the federal council that she had not
                  resigned, still maintaining control over the party's public
                  communications. During this time May says she was told by
                  Paul's staff to remain quiet. May states that she decided to
                  speak out when Paul, still under control of party
                  communication, refused to release news about the appointment
                  of Lorraine Rekmans, a member of Canada’s Indigenous community
                  as president of the Green Party Executive Council. Paul also
                  went on to prevent President Rekmans from releasing a public
                  statement on Canada’s first ever National Day of Truth and
                  Reconciliation.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  We now come to the present day, where Annamie Paul is still
                  involved in “exit negotiations” with the party after publicly
                  resigning on September 28th. Her lawyers are negotiating with
                  the party over monetary compensation in regard to the money
                  spent by Paul when fighting the initial leadership review in
                  July. The party just recently called for a second leadership
                  review in which general members of the Party get to voice
                  their support or opposition to Paul as leader, this review
                  will conclude November 25th.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  This is but a brief and cursory summary of the Green Party's
                  past few months dealing with Annamie Paul. The very fact that
                  such intimate details regarding the party’s affairs and
                  relationship with the leader are public is very telling of its
                  current state. What is clear from the past few months is that
                  many of the decisions made by Paul as leader seemed to favour
                  her own wellbeing, policies, and goals, over those of the
                  party she is meant to represent.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  The appointment of Annamie Paul as leader has seen the Green
                  Party devolve into chaos. From fundamental differences in
                  regard to what the Green leadership position is, to
                  inexplicably bad decisions on the part of Paul, in the last
                  few months and in this last federal election we have seen the
                  party lose much of the national presence and support it once
                  held. This is nothing but bad news for all Canadians. Whether
                  you support the Green party or not, its existence as a party
                  squarely focused on protecting our environment is crucial to
                  maintaining an adequate level of pressure regarding
                  environmental protection policy on all of Canada’s political
                  parties. It will be most interesting to see how, when, and if
                  the party is able to recover from its recent controversy, and
                  who will be the right individual to guide this resurgence.
