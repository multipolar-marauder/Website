                <h3>The PPC: Canada’s Growing Far Right-Wing Populist Party</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="blog-content">
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Liberal. Conservative. Green. New Democrat. Bloc Québécois. In
                  recent history, these were the 5 main federal political
                  parties in Canada. Enter the People’s Party of Canada (PPC).
                  This new party was formed by Maxime Bernier in September 2018,
                  a former Conservative member of parliament (MP) who the year
                  previous had run for party leadership. Bernier was the sole MP
                  in the PPC before losing his seat in 2019, with no other PPC
                  candidates winning an MP seat since.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  The PPC can be regarded as part of the right-wing populist
                  movement that has seen a rise around the world. With several
                  of the signatory members responsible for founding the PPC
                  being involved with far-right anti-immigration groups like the
                  National Alliance. The party supports the implementation of
                  reduced Immigration to Canada, getting rid of the Canada
                  Multiculturalism act, etc. More recently they have been
                  campaigning against COVID-19 mask mandates, social distancing,
                  lockdowns, and mandatory vaccinations. This alternate stance
                  on COVID-19 protection measures which goes against expert
                  medical opinions has helped the PPC rise in popularity during
                  the recent 2021 federal election. Although the party was
                  unsuccessful in its attempt to elect its candidates, the vote
                  count for their candidates went from 294,092 (1.6%) in the
                  previous federal election to 841,005 (4.9%) in 2021.
                  Effectively leapfrogging the Green party who received a total
                  of 398,021 votes (the party still holds two federal parliament
                  seats) in the 2021 election.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Recently party leader Maxime Bernier received some flak for a
                  tweet he put out about a perceived “offensive request” from
                  several journalists whom he called “far left activists
                  masquerading as journalists.” He followed up this tweet with
                  another where he continued to use strong language when
                  describing the journalists, even providing their email
                  addresses to supporters and telling supporters to let the
                  journalists know what they thought of their work. Using the
                  sentence “They want to play dirty, we will play dirty too in
                  his tweet.” This type of rhetoric aimed at the media is most
                  similar to that of former American President Donald Trump.
                  President Trump would routinely attack the media covering his
                  time in office, with tweets such as this one being very
                  frequent: “The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to
                  make us look bad. Sad!”.

                    Journalists have a legal and ethical obligation to send
                    questions and request comment from our politicians. Going
                    after them for doing their basic duty is unacceptable and
                    dangerous behaviour.

                  The Canadian Association of Journalists responded to the
                  Bernier tweets outlining the important work done by
                  journalists, stating that “Going after them” was wrong and
                  should be avoided. Generally, I would agree with this
                  sentiment, the Canadian political landscape should be one
                  where attacking journalists is frowned upon. With Bernier
                  mirroring Trump’s playbook in regards to the press, we as a
                  country are also mirroring our American neighbours when we
                  consider the amount of polarization that exists between the
                  left and the right. Whether the PPC is the cause of this
                  polarization or the symptom of said polarization is
                  questionable, but what we can say for sure is that its mere
                  existence does illustrate the increased polarization between
                  people in Canada.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  The current state of the PPC raises three key questions we can
                  consider when thinking about their future. Firstly, what will
                  happen to the party once the COVID-19 pandemic ends, will the
                  increase in party popularity seen during the pandemic
                  dissipate, or will new members remain loyal to the PPC?
                  Secondly, what does the long-term future of the PPC look like?
                  Will they grow in size and become a constant in Canadian
                  politics, like a conservative form of the NDP or will they
                  wither away and remain as a party similar to the Greens, on
                  the fringe but always in the conversation. Thirdly, for the
                  PPC to grow substantially in size what would need to happen to
                  the conservative party? What sort of policy shift or scandal
                  would need to occur for a significant vote bleed?
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  These questions and the future of the PPC in general will very
                  much dictate Canada’s future political landscape, and in fact,
                  be a strong reflection of the issues that divide our nation.
                  The party's growth will illustrate a decisive choice made by
                  Canadians, a decisive choice made by you. Do we as a country
                  want to become more divided and polarized like the United
                  States, or not?
