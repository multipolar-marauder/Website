                                Definitions and measurements will vary from source to source. Generally speaking, excess deaths

                                It is important to note that countries can vary in the recording/reporting/data collection methods. Independent
                                countries have different rules for causes of death classification, along with undercoverage issues. Nonetheless,

                                As expected, many excess deaths between 2020-2022 are attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and take a large percentage of
                                mortality. Excess death, excluding COVID-19, have also seen a substantial rise between 2020-2022.

                                Definitions of what constitutes and is recorded as a COVID-19 death can also vary from country to country.

                                a significant condition contributing to death.”</i> Canada’s definition of a COVID-19 death is similar: 
                                <i>“A probable or confirmed COVID-19 case whose death resulted from a clinically compatible illness, unless there is a

                                collected excess mortality in 2020-2021 from 74 countries. They found that Worldwide, there were approximately 5.94
                                million deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors estimate that about 17.1-19.6 million people died due to the
                                pandemic altogether, and that: <i>“The global all-age rate of excess mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic was 120.3 deaths (113.1–129.3) per 100 000 of
                                the population, and excess mortality rate exceeded 300 deaths per 100 000 of the population in 21 countries”</i>

                                estimates <i>“47,727 excess deaths in Canada from the end of March 2020 to the beginning of June 2022, 7.4% more deaths than expected
                                without the pandemic. During this period, at least 38,265 deaths were directly attributed to COVID-19.”</i>
                                About 9,400 of those excess deaths were not from COVID-19, and Statistics Canada states these are due to
                                <i>“indirect impacts of the pandemic, such as increased substance use and delayed medical procedures/diagnostics, may
                                explain some excess mortality observed in Canada, including for those under the age of 45.”</i>
                                Unfortunately, that is about as far as Canadian statistics/data go on excess mortality. Compared to other countries,
                                Canada’s statistics on excess mortality is lacking.

                                COVID-19, there was massive increase in non-COVID-19 related mortality among the youth.”</i>
                                COVID-19 accounted for 53.8% of all excess deaths from January 2020 to May 2021 (Beeson et al., 2022).
