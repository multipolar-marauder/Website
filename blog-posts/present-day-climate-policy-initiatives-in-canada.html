                <p class="blog-text">
                  Upon every election, Canadians throughout North America are
                  introduced to worthwhile promises by politicians and their
                  respective parties in hopes of not only uniting voters for a
                  specific cause, but to collect enough votes to occupy the
                  federal government position. I think that sums up the federal
                  election process pretty well. A staple topic within these
                  promises, as we continue to witness the global deterioration
                  of our Earth’s health, has undoubtedly been climate policy and
                  Canada’s role within a domestic and global context.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  However, while the topic of climate change was first tackled
                  by global leaders during the 1980s, Canadian efforts of
                  mitigating industrial and corporate harm done to the
                  environment have almost receded to absolute redundancy
                  (MacNeil 2019, p. 9). I mean, let's have a look at when the
                  climate crisis was legitimately approached by our
                  Canadian-elected leaders. Approaching the end of the Mulroney
                  (PC) government’s term, climate change mandates were first
                  implemented during 1988 (MacNeil 2019, p. 9). While Mulroney’s
                  government seemed fit for the job, and while they had
                  successfully persuaded multiple parliamentary members of
                  supporting environmental protectionist legislation such as the
                  Environmental Assessment Act, in comparison to today, I
                  struggle to accept that governments such as that of the Harper
                  administration or even the current-Trudeau administration have
                  invested nearly as much time and effort as their predecessor.
                  Despite the increasing access to resources and the rapid
                  development of renewable energy technology, it is clear the
                  climate policy in Canada isn’t a matter of funding or voter
                  opinion, but rather, who’s got the best bid in terms of paying
                  off the nation’s top industrial exports (MacNeil 2019, p. 10).
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  Let’s have a look at the Harper and Trudeau years. With regard
                  to the former, Harper’s government was beyond successful at
                  doing everything but building off of the foundation the
                  Mulroney government had built for Canada in both a domestic
                  and global context. Rather than further developing current and
                  new legislation and mandates to limit and protect Canadian
                  environmental assets, the Harper governments’ implementation
                  of the Growth and Long-Term Prosperity Act served to take
                  Canada several years back with regards to its climate policy
                  progress (MacNeil 2019, p. 25). By doing so, Harper’s
                  government essentially removed all restrictions of industries
                  such as that of the energy and fishing industries, thus
                  optimizing the extractive potential for said groups to
                  capitalize off of Canada’s natural resources (MacNeil 2019, p.
                  25, 26). However, Harpers’ disastrous efforts don’t tally up
                  here. Aside from pulling Canada of the well-known Kyoto
                  protocol (international treaty aiming for signatories to
                  reduce greenhouse gas emissions), in the years following,
                  Harper’s government had successfully and categorically
                  delegitimized Canadian-based environmental groups, ultimately
                  allowing the federal government to radically defund them and
                  place strict measures on their operational activities (MacNeil
                  2019, p. 26). While I’ve barely skimmed the surface, it’s
                  clear that Harper’s government has fulfilled its duty to
                  Canadians and voters with its corporate-fueled policy
                  implementation tactics.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  On the other hand, Trudeau’s government, while on paper may
                  seem like the poster-boy for progressives and one of Canada’s
                  only opportunities of retaining its ranking in the global
                  arena for climate policy efforts, it’s fallen down a rather
                  alternative rabbit hole in comparison to its PC counterpart.
                  The Canadian Liberal party, notorious for its consistent
                  fallouts on its promises, was elected in 2015 with the hopes
                  of environmentalists and Canadians soaring through the roof as
                  they believed the environmental turmoil Harper’s PC government
                  had put them through was finally over. To an extent, their
                  hopes were justified and met. Immediately, Trudeu’s government
                  implemented several climate change policies including that of
                  increased funding to the UN’s Green Climate Fund, the
                  elimination of Federal fossil fuel subsidies, and the
                  upholding of Canada’s global emission levels (MacNeil 2019, p.
                  35). While Trudeau’s liberal government held power in
                  primarily all of the Canadian provinces with the exception of
                  Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, its failure of having said
                  states sign onto its ‘Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth
                  and Climate Change’ introduced a series of uncalculated
                  mishaps. As Trudeau’s government attempted to exchange carbon
                  prices for an oil pipeline (Kinder Morgan pipeline), British
                  Columbia’s NDP premier, John Horgan, made the final call of
                  preventing the project from taking place. As a result, not
                  only did Trudeau’s plans fall through, but the pro-climate
                  premiers who had initially endorsed Trudeau’s plans had also
                  been replaced with more conservative figures, who in turn,
                  have also impeded and tarnished Trudeau efforts of further
                  developing Canada’s climate strategy.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  So, what’s there to take from this? On one hand, the two
                  competing powers in Canada–PC and Liberal–have been in a
                  constant cycle of blaming their predecessors and each other
                  for Canada’s poor climate strategy performance. While both
                  parties have acknowledged the previous mishaps, and have
                  committed to providing long-term solutions, one has completely
                  disregarded the promises it has made–Harper government
                  (PC)–while the other–Trudeau government (Lib.)–has faced
                  rather harsh criticism and a series of barriers from its
                  provincial counterparts as it strives to uphold its promises.
                  It’s safe to say that while climate change is a serious issue
                  on the minds of many voters, climate policy as a political
                  project has become a field of corporate and industrial
                  interests. Perhaps a future of NDP or Green federalism will
                  voice the concerns of Canadians and strive to successfully
                  meet their demands?
