                                Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is a densely populated Asian country that has faced manyyears of repressive military
                                regimes. Myanmar had fought for many years to become ademocracy, but its duration was cut short. Myanmar is infamous for
                                its ethnic cleansing ofRohingya Muslims during this democratic period, courtesy of Myanmar’s military. Despite
                                allefforts, the influence was always prevalent, and changes were far from fruition. Myanmarcontinues to be one of Asia’s
                                most impoverished countries, with little to no economic growthover the years. After the 2021 coup, the chaos has grown
                                into a violent civil war between themilitary and the opposition

                                Dubbed the Tatmadaw, they were established before independence from the British in 1948. Thearmy was one of the
                                strongholds of the one-party state that Myanmar had established. The armyhad the last word in critical decisions and
                                always had control over general citizens. Though theyhave faced lots of resistance over the years, external funding from
                                Russia and China has allowedthem to continue with oppressive practices. Protestors are considered criminals, given there
                                is noopposition during military regimes. The army continues to brutalize protestors and hold themcaptive. Since the 2021
                                coup, Myanmar has captured over 10,000 political prisoners. Over thepast few months, many soldiers have fled the army,
                                causing numbers to dwindle. However, thishasn’t resulted in a significant rupture in Tatmadaw’s power within the
                                country.

                                Myanmar has ordered all retirees to lace their boots up and join the force again. If they refuse todo so, they will face
                                severe consequences and their pensions will be nullified. The Army lacksany form of basic humanity towards its members
                                and the country’s citizens. They are furtherproving why they’re considered one of the most dangerous institutions in
                                Asia.

                                Over 350 militias have risen over the past year, with mere crude rifles and explosives. People’sdefence forces, dubbed
                                PDFs, have combined with other ethnic minorities to rebel against thetreacherous army. Though disjointed, they stand

                                The location of many former government officials is still unknown. The former government hadjust won a landslide
                                election and was poised to continue progressing Myanmar down a brightpath. The military abused its powers to
                                delegitimize many government initiatives and madeunfounded claims about election results. India, Russia and China
                                continue to support and provideweaponry, despite all the backlash they’ve received over the past year. Their actions
                                haveessentially neutralized the Western World’s initiative to sanction and identify Myanmar as acountry of particular
                                concern. Despite all that has occurred, Western society’s actions aren'tenough. After backing up Ukraine and providing
                                resistance groups with the necessary resources,it’s questionable why the same initiative isn’t occurring for Myanmar.
                                Myanmar people continueto suffer while the army spreads its reign of terror and further legitimatizes itself
                                internationallywith sham elections. Myanmar is facing an impending collapse, just a year after the militarycoup. Half of
                                Myanmar is currently living in poverty, with 14.4 million needing humanitarianassistance to survive. The World Bank that
                                the coup and the pandemic had cost Myanmar 30% ofits economy. Myanmar will take many years to recover from the damage
                                that has occurred, andthis is just the beginning of the turmoil this densely populated nation will continue to face.

                                production has decreased drastically. This willeither lead to sham elections or an opportunity for the general
