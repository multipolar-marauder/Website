                  The arrest and death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini sparked the protests. Morality
                  police arrested her on September 13th for allegedly violating Iran’s laws which require
                  women to cover their hair. The police report stated she suffered from a heart attack; however,
                  alleged evidence indicates Amini was beaten on the head with a baton. Protests began shortly
                  after her funeral when women ripped their headscarves in solidarity. Since then, protests have
                  continued as the people demand fundamental human rights from the state
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  While the protests initially began in reaction to Mahsa Amini’s murder, they have
                  become a movement demanding equal rights for women in Iran. Iran is known to be an
                  Islamic state and enforces strict laws requiring everyone to adhere to Muslim standards and
                  beliefs. This includes the mandatory wearing of a headscarf or hijab and the covering of
                  women’s bodies. The people of Iran, the women of Iran, want bodily autonomy; they want
                  the right to <b>choose</b>. Since Mahsa Amini’s death, protestors have continued rioting on Iran’s
                  streets. As of November 10th, 2022, at least 328 people have been killed and 14,825 others
                  arrested, according to human rights activists in Iran. Local activists have been monitoring the
                  protests since they began on September 16th
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                  According to BBC, one female protester in her 20s, who spent a week in prison and
                  was recently released on bail, stated that she witnessed “physical and psychological torture,
                  and other ill-treatment, prison guards refusing to give jailers their medications, women
                  having their hands smashed so severely that all their fingernails are broken, prisoners with
                  cancer being refused treatment, countless prisoners are forced to stay in jail because judges
                  are demanding hefty bails, Women are now setting their headscarves on fire and cutting their
                  hair in public whilst chanting “women, life, freedom” and death to the dictator” – this being
                  in reference to the current leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

                  For weeks the Iranian government has remained silent on casualty figures while state
                  media has continuously claimed the security forces have killed no one. They continue to play
                  down demonstrations and suppress protestors with force. The supreme leader has even
                  accused the United States and Israel (state enemies to Iran) of orchestrating “riots .”
                  Currently, Iranian lawmakers have urged the country’s judiciary to show no leniency to
                  protestors as thousands continue to riot on the streets. Reportedly on November 6th, in an
                  open letter signed by 227 of Iran’s 290 members of Parliament, the lawmakers called for
                  protestors to be taught a “good lesson” to deter threats to the state (protestors, activists. The
                  Iranian Parliament has deemed those partaking in riots and demonstrations are now enemies
                  of God and, therefore, should be punishable by death.

                  Nobody is exempt from the wrath of the regime. Iranian celebrities are among those
                  who are facing charges for speaking out against the government. In November, Hengameh
                  Ghaziani and Katayoun Riahi were arrested for “provocative” social media posts that showed
                  their hair. They are accused of <b>inciting and supporting the “riots”</b> and communicating with
                  opposition media. One of Iran’s most famous actresses, Taraneh Alidoosti, was detained by
                  Iranian authorities for criticizing the state’s use of the death penalty against protestors. Before
                  her arrest Taraneh had made a post on her social media of a picture of herself in which she
                  was not wearing the hijab and holding a piece of paper reading “women, life, freedom.” –
                  This is the slogan used by activists.

                <p class="blog-text">
                  The United States, European Union, Canada and the United Kingdom have imposed
                  sanctions on Iranian officials and entities. In return, Tehran (the capital of Iran) has responded
                  with sanctions of their own. Over the last few months, serious concerns have arisen about
                  Iran’s role in international policy. In December, the 54-member UN Economic and Social
                  Council (ECOSOC) adopted a resolution proposed by the United States to remove Iran from
                  the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) for the remainder of its four-year term (until
                  2026); in return, Iran rejected this proposal. The country’s ambassador stated, “It is not at all
                  unexpected that the United States is taking such unlawful action against Iran, given its
                  long-standing hostility towards the Iranian people, but if carried out, it would be exceedingly
                  dangerous to the UN system integrity.” Despite the government cracking down on protestors,
                  the people of Iran refuse to back down and continue to show their resilience and dedication in
                  their fight for equality.
