                                Florida Governor Ron DeSantis just made the lives of LGBTQ+ 
                                kids much harder with his push for the “Parental Rights in
                                Education” bill. If you didn’t know, the Florida Senate Education 
                                Committee just advanced legislation that critics have
                                dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.
                                <a style="color: maroon" target="_blank" 
                                href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/dont-say-gay-bill-florida-desantis-b2074720.html">
                                    This Legislation States</a> 
                                that “classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on 
                                sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur
                                in kindergarten through [third grade]” or “in a manner that is not 
                                age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for
                                students in accordance with state standards” in other grades. The 
                                bill does not go on to define what would be considered
                                “age-appropriate” or “developmentally appropriate”.
                            </p>

                                it explicitely states</a>
                            that parents can sue schools for violating the law and by not telling them 
                            about “critical decisions affecting a student’s mental, emotional, or 
                            physical health or wellbeing.” So, the court can award damages and even 
                            attorney’s fees if they have proven that a school has violated the measure. 
                            Once again, they do not go into specifics as to what this all means.

                                The lawmaker who proposed this stated that this was meant to keep the

                                the bill does not even mention school curriculums. Although there are 
                                several obvious loopholes and issues, the bill was
                                passed by Florida’s House of Representatives on February 24. On March

                                    the state senate voted to pass the bill by a vote of 22-17</a>
                                with two republicans siding with democrats against this bill.

                                It is expected for Governor Ron DeSantis to sign the bill as he has publicly

                                While conservatives have argued that this legislation is about parental

                                deemed it as clear discrimination against LGBTQ+ youth. Schools have

                                of 82,000 youth participants found that 30% considered their home

                                    President Joe Biden had chimed in tweeting</a>

                                who will be impacted by this hateful bill — to know that you are loved 
                                and accepted just as you are. I have your back, and my Administration 
                                will continue to fight for the protections and safety you deserve.” 
                                Over the last few weeks, hundreds of students across Florida have 
                                staged walkouts, especially after the bill had been passed by Florida’s 
                                senate.

                                There are several similar proposals that have been floating around in 
                                states like Tennessee, Kansas, Indiana, and Oklahoma which restrict 
                                LGBTQ+ topics, identities, issues, and history being taught in schools.
