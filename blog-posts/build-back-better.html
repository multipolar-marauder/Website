									am not here to ruffle feathers or make this a ‘left’ vs ‘right’ discussion. The language and conversations of left vs
									right, conservative vs liberal, democrat vs republican are dangerous and nonsensical. It restricts discussion and

								</p>
                <p class="blog-text">
									Two years ago, many would be unfamiliar with the name Klaus Schwab. Still, in 2022, this name does not carry any weight
									for most people. Klaus Schwab was born in 1938 in Germany. A highly educated man, he has a doctorate degree in economics
									and received many other honorary degrees from several prestigious schools worldwide. Schwab founded the European
									Management Forum in 1971, later becoming as it is known today, the World Economic Forum in 1987.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
									Directly from the World Economic Forum (WEF) website, the organization is “an independent international organization
									committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic and other leaders of society to
									shape global, regional and industry agendas” (The World Economic Forum, 2021). WEF leaders, stakeholders, prominent
									world politicians, journalists, activists, and wealthy elites visit Geneva, Switzerland, for the WEF conference each
									year. As the head of the board of trustees, Schwab is the only one who can name his successor. This means Schwab and his
									heirs are the only permanent members of the WEF.

									Have you heard any current politician, world leader, or ‘elite’ express the need to Build Back Better? Well, here are
									many examples of Boris Johnson, Joe Biden, Justin Trudeau, Bill Gates, Jacinda Ardern, Greta Thunberg, news anchors,

                <p class="blog-text">
									The daileyexpose’s <i> Build Back Better</i> (2021) offers a great timeline (2014 to 2021) of the WEF’s intentions to reshape,
									restart, reboot, and reset the global order. Articles from the WEF website such as <i> We need to press restart on the
									global economy</i> (Nov 2015) and <i>How to Reboot the Global Economy</i> (Jan 2017) outline the need for a restart and how to do
									it. In 2018-2019, the WEF, Johns Hopkins & Gates Foundation ran fake pandemic scenarios and the global responses
									(Exposé, 2021). What is clear is that before the COVID-19 pandemic, the WEF has expressed the need for a ‘reset’ and how
									to go through with one.
                </p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									Remember politicians stating the need to Build Back Better from the pandemic? In the article <i>Want to build back better?
									Let innovators come to you</i> (July 2021) the WEF explains how we can use the pandemic to build back better. This is just
									one of the many articles, videos, reports, and conferences of Schwab and fellow WEF associates on record vocalizing the
									importance of the <b>current pandemic</b> to incorporate a New World Economy.

									<h5 class="author1" style="text-decoration: underline;">Unsolicited Proposals</h5>
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									The WEF’s main goals and ideas for a New World Economy seem well-intended. A WEF article <i>Unsolicited proposals: the best
									to way to build back better</i> (July 2021) uses language such as the need for global inclusion, sustainability and
									innovation. One of their plans for the future economy is making the private sector (small/large businesses) present to
									the government through Unsolicited proposals (Unsolicited proposals, 2021). The private sector must obtain approval from
									the government (based on criteria defined by them) rather than an existing competitive bidding process (Unsolicited
									proposals, 2021). The government will ultimately decide if a project ‘benefits’ the community based on their
									definitions.
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									Why will the private sector have to go to the government for approval? Is it in the name of global inclusion,
									sustainability, and innovation like the WEF preaches? It could be. But when the private sector or small business obtains
									approval, how will they be funded? Where is the money coming from? What is the WEF’s view on the future of banking,
									paper money and digital currency?
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
								<h5 class="author1" style="text-decoration: underline;">Centralized World Bank:</h5>
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									A May 2019 report published from the WEF titled <i>Central Banks and Distributed Ledger Technology: How are Central Banks
									Exploring Blockchain Today?</i> (May 2019) we get a look into their future ideas of money. In this 14 page report: “ at
									least 40 central banks around the world are currently (2019), or soon will be, researching and experimenting with
									central bank digital currency” (Central Banks and Distributed Ledger Technology: How are Central Banks Exploring
									Blockchain Today?, 2019 pg 4).
									</p>
									<p class = "blog-text">
										The Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) functions as a centralized digital World bank while competing with
										decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum:
									<div class="container">
											<div class="row">
												<div class="col-sm-2"></div>
												<div class="col-sm-8">
													<p style="font-size: 80%; font-style: italic;" >
														“In many of these CBDC pilots, the central bank issues digital tokens on a distributed ledger that represent, and are
														redeemable for, central bank reserves in the domestic currency held in a separate account with the central bank. The
														agents in the system use the CBDC to make interbank transfers that are validated and settled on the distributed ledger.
														<br>
														The central banks typically use <b> “permissioned” </b> blockchain network implementations, whereby <b> participants are limited and
														must be granted access to participate </b> in the network and view the set of transactions. In contrast, major
														“permissionless” blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, allow public participation and full transaction viewability.
														Both permissioned and permissionless networks can add privacy and confidentiality features to mask transaction details
														where appropriate” (Central Banks and Distributed Ledger Technology: How are Central Banks Exploring Blockchain Today?,
														2019 pg 5).
													</p>
													
												</div>
												<div class="col-sm-2"></div>
											</div>
									</div>
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									The WEF states that decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin are “permissionless.” Meaning you do not need to go through
									the government to receive it. In contrast, to receive digital funds from the CBDC, we need permission or granted access
									to participate. Under one centralized government bank, they will have full access to your account and what goes in and
									out. Instead of earning money from the private sector, you will receive the digital funds directly from the government
									in a “delivery versus payment” system (Central Banks and Distributed Ledger Technology: How are Central Banks Exploring
									Blockchain Today?, 2019 pg 7).
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									How, when, and why will the government directly give or subtract a digital payment from one Centralized World Bank? What
									will happen to paper money?
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									<h5 class="author1" style="text-decoration: underline;">Alternative Credit Scores:</h5>
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									As we know, “the current credit score system with banks help lenders decide whether or not to approve loan applications.
									The scores are generated using information from your credit reports, which summarize your borrowing history. Credit
									scores are designed to make decisions easier for lenders” (Pritchard, 2021).
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									A WEF article titled  <i>This new approach to credit scoring is accelerating financial inclusion in emerging economies </i> (Jan
									2021) discusses an alternative to the current credit score model, called the Alternative Credit Score. The article
									examines the need for a new credit scoring model that, with the help of computer algorithms, will “use alternative data
									such as  <b> social media, electronic transactions, </b> and <b> cellular data </b> to conduct and assess the consumer’s feasibility” (This
									new approach to credit scoring is accelerating financial inclusion in emerging economies, 2021). The data from the
									Alternative Credit Score (ACS) will also “help financial institutions make holistic and thorough risk analyses regarding
									potential consumers through a more comprehensive approach” (This new approach to credit scoring is accelerating
									financial inclusion in emerging economies, 2021).
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									Does this alternative credit score sound familiar? Is there a system similar to the ACS? If you can not think of one, I
									would encourage you to look up the Chinese Communist Party and their Social Credit Score.
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									<h5 class="author1" style="text-decoration: underline;">WEF & Canada:</h5>
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									So far, I have shown just a few of the WEF’s intentions and plans for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Have their
									missions been successful? Are world leaders following the WEF’s procedures? Well, the answer is yes. How? Let us look at
									a wonderful example here in our country of Canada. During the 2016 annual meeting of the WEF, the Prime Minister of
									Canada, Justin Trudeau, raves about his relationship with Klaus Schwab and the future of Canada under the WEF.
									<br>
									<br>

										target="_blank" 
										href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByIejZDQNmc">
										Davos 2016 - The Canadian Opportunity</a
										>
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									In a separate clip of Schwab during a John F. Kennedy School of Government meeting in 2017, Schwab brags about how he
									has ‘penetrated’ all of Trudeau's cabinet with complete positivity:
									<br>
									<br>

									href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhHmy9AQLBA">
										Klaus Schwab talking about penetrating Justin Trudeau's cabinet (longer version)</a
										>
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									How many Canadians do you know are aware of this? Shouldn’t something like a powerful institution of WEF’s ‘penetration’
									of our sovereign democracy be reported on? What are these politicians hiding? Why has the cabinet been so silent about
									this ‘penetration’? Not only does Schwab and the WEF influence Trudeau’s cabinet, but he also talks about his massive command over many
									other countries and world leaders, like the current President of France, Emmanuel Macron.
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									<h5 class="author1" style="text-decoration: underline;">Chrystia Freeland & The WEF:</h5>
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									Among Trudeau’s cabinet is Chrystia Freeland, the current deputy prime minister of Canada (2019) and the minister of
									finance (2020). Now, does our deputy prime minister and our minister of finance have relations with the WEF? She
									absolutely does. An article from the WEF offers an excellent biography on Freeland while noting she is a <b> current member
									of the WEF’s Board of Trustees</b> (Chrystia Freeland, WEF).
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									What is Freeland and the current government doing right that can give us deeper insight into the future with WEF? The
									handling of the TruckerConvoy by the federal government is just the beginning of their greater plans. Say what you want
									about the TruckerConvoy. I do not care what your opinions about it are. Throw that out the window. Let us just look
									objectively at what the government did to handle the ‘illegal protestors’
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									<h5 class="author1" style="text-decoration: underline;">Emergency Powers & FINTRAC:</h5>
									</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									On February 14, Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act, essentially giving the Federal government full unconstitutional
									power. Among these unconstitutional powers is the ability of the government to control your bank account. From a CBC
									article on Feb 16: “banks and other financial entities (like credit unions, co-ops, loan companies, trusts and
									cryptocurrency platforms) must stop “providing any financial or related services” to people associated with the protests
									— a move that will <b>result in frozen accounts, stranded money and cancelled credit cards”</b> (John Paul Tasker, 2022).
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									Do not worry, I have plenty of videos of Freeland to show. Freeland explains why and how the government will access
									individual Canadian banks in chronological order. Please watch all these videos to get the full context:

									intelligence unit that monitors monetary transactions to identify and prevent illegal activities such as money
									laundering and financing of terrorist organizations” (Kenton, 2020). Sounds good, right? FINTRAC is what the government
									used to investigate and seize the truckers’ bank information, and Freeland admitted that FINTRAC will permanently stay,
									despite the Emergency powers being ‘temporary’?
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									Do you think these ‘tools’ like FINTRAC will remain in place to be used for good? Does this sound like the beginning of
									a centralized government bank (previously discussed) where the government has direct access to your account and will
									actively monitor your spending? They have already used it on Canadian citizens. All of this will go away once the
									protest is dealt with, right? Probably not. Again, Freeland stated herself FINTRAC will remain permanently.
									Here is what the interim police chief of Ottawa has to say about the protestors:

								Words directly from the police chief about protestors who have retreated: “Anyone involved in this protest, we will
								<b>actively</b> identify you and follow up with <b>financial sanctions</b> and criminal charges.” But, there must be a way for the
								citizens to get their accounts back and unfrozen, right? Do not fear, Freeland summarizes how citizens can avoid
								sanctions and bank seizures:

									In her own words: “the way you get your account unfrozen is to stop being a part of these ‘illegal’ blockades.” She says
									it herself, clear as day. Stop protesting, or we will take control of your bank account.
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									But this is only for the TruckerConvoy, right? We will see. Some of these emergency ‘tools’ are permanently in place,
									what stops the government from using them for reasons other than these ‘illegal’ protests? Will they be used on future
									protests or Canadian citizens who disagree with the government? Who is in charge of deeming a protest and participators
									‘unlawful’? Time will tell.

								<p class="blog-text">
								<h5 class="author1" style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion:</h5>
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									I know this report entails a lot of information, and there is a lot to digest. But I want to reiterate that this is not
									a conspiracy. Almost all information I found about the WEF was from their websites, articles and videos. I am here to
									show you the direction they are going in. A “New Global Economy” where the government controls the private sector,
									direct access and monitoring of your bank account, one Centralized World Bank (CBDC), and an Alternative Credit Score.
									We now know the WEF has ‘penetrated’ almost all of Trudeau’s cabinet, including Chrystia Freeland, who is on the WEF’s
									Board of Trustees. We also know, with the TruckerConvoy, that the same government implemented tools to monitor and
									freeze bank accounts.
								</p>
								<p class="blog-text">
									This is the direction the WEF is going, whether we like it or not. At the end of the day, it is up to us, the citizens,
									to decide if this is the road we want to go down. Needless to say, we are already well on our way to the current WEF
									path. Check out WEF articles, videos, reports, and conference meetings to look into our future. It was not hard to find.
									The WEF is open and transparent about its goals and aspirations for the future World economy.
